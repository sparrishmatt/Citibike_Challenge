# Citibike Challenge
 
## Purpose of Analysis

The goal of this challenge was to take biking data from the company "Citibike" and create visualizations through Tableau. Visualizations of different types were created with the goal of helping to create some business relevant suggestions through our visuals. 

For this analysis specifically, most of the visuals have to do with common times that bikes were rented, and how the rental data changes based on gender.

## Analysis Results

The best way to communicate with data to those on the business side of your company is to create understandable visuals (meaning understandable to somebody that may not have the same experience reading graphs, using statistics, etc). Therefore it would be best at this point to start displaying these visuals and talking about them.

### Visual 1: Average Ride Length

Most Citibike bike rentals last around 20 minutes as can be seen here, with almost no rentals lasting longer than an hour. These ideas can also be seen in the caption in the image, which is a feature of Tableau stories.

### Visual 2: Average Ride Length by Gender
---

By splitting the average ride length from visual 1 out to display average length by gender, we can see that the average length of a ride is similar between males, females, and those of unknown gender at around 20 minutes once again. Another interesting point is the much larger number of rentals by males during this time, which gives an idea of the user base.

### Visual 3: Gender Distribution of Citibike Users

While piecharts are not a best practice when it comes to data visualization, this will work due to the small number of fields. We can see again here that the majority of Citibike users are male, with female and unknown users being much closer to each other.

### Visual 4: Rental Time 
---

Heatmaps are great for showing frequency data based on time. This can be seen with calendar heatmaps which are common in the business world. In this case, the heatmap is showing the most common times that bikes are rented during the different days of the week. Rental times are much more focused during business days, which can be seen through the darker shades at specific hours, while weekends have a much wider spread of common rental times.

---

### Visual 5: Rental Time Totals
---

This provides similar information to the heatmap from visual 4. The two peaks throughout the day are at 8am and the hours around 5-6pm.

---

### Visual 6: Rental Time by Gender
---

Unfortunately the whole heatmap will not fit into this screenshot. But from what we can see between male and female rental times, both are following the same trends as seen in the heatmap from visual 4. Of course the male section will be darker due to a larger amount of riders, but the shape of both maps are the same.

---

### Visual 7: Rental Day by Customer/Subscriber and Gender
---
<img src="https://github.com/sparrishmatt/Citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/fig5.png" height="400">

Here we can see that for those that are not subscribed to Citibike services that the gender and day distribution are very similar. However, subscribers are much more commonly male as expected. Subscribers to the service also have a mostly even distribution for weekday. 


## Summary

Our main findings through the use of Tableau to create visualizations were that the current (current as of August 2019 at least) Citibike userbase is mostly male, and that the most common ride times during the week are around when people would get off of work, while weekend rides have more widely distributed stop times. Of course there are many more ideas that could be put toward these visuals to provide business insight, but generally it is best to choose a few questions to answer with your visuals as opposed to trying to explain 100% of the data. These focused visuals will allow the end user to make decisions related to these points instead of distracting them with many other unrelated visuals.
